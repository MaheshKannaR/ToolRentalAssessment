# ToolRentalAssessment

This project is a Tool Rental System developed using Spring Boot for assessment. This allows users to rent tools from an H2 database. Users can check out tools by providing necessary inputs such as checkout date, tool code, number of days for rental, and discount percentage. Charges will be calculated based on various factors such as No Charge Days (weekdays, weekends, and holidays) and Discounts as well.
